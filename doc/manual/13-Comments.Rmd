# Comments

Comments can be embedded within an expression to clarify its intent.
C/C++ style comments are supported, which provide:

- multi-line comments (text within a pair of `/*` and `*/`).
- single line comments (everything after a `//` until the end of the current line).

For example, assuming that the variables `P_LEVEL` and `N_OBS` have been
defined within the parser, an expression such as this could be used:

```cpp
/* Returns the p-level of a study if:
   p-level < 5% AND
   number of observations was at least 30.
   Otherwise, NaN is returned. */

IF(// Review the results from the analysis
   AND(P_LEVEL < .05, N_OBS >= 30),
   // ...and return the p-level if we should accpet it
   P_LEVEL,
   // or NaN if not
   NAN)
```
